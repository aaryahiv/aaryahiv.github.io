      <description>Service
Considering the difficult times during this global pandemic and lockdown, I have decided to provide help and service to ones with dogs. Any person or families in which walking the dog is a difficult task right now, I am here to help. With my prior and current experience of living with a dog and knowing how to handle many dogs, I will be able to walk the dogs. Though I have certain policies as per handling the dogs and their nature, I hope that this will bring attention to families with dogs in need of help and assistance.</description>
